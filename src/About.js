<p>This is an unofficial website for Immortal Playable Characters minted on the unsupported version 0 contract that was deployed in 2018.</p>

<p>The wrapper this website uses provides a layer of security and meta data that the original v0 (version 0) contract did not offer.</p>

<p>It is unknown exactly what went wrong with v0 which means as a collector you must accept those risks and do your own research before buying into this collection.</p>

<p>The best way to learn more is to join our discord in the links above.</p>

<H1>What are IPC's</H1>
<p><I>"Highly functional NFTs designed to provide lifelong game characters as your partners in adventure and imagination."</I></p>

<H1>What's special about v0s?</H1>
<p>The v0 contract was deployed on <B><Link href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x62b674f6385cd319b5c7d536635e9930df26b1e5a747b8b8e02442fa5cda02ea">March 14th 2018</Link></B>, making it a historical piece of NFT history.</p>

<H1>What's the official stance on v0?</H1>
<p><I>"It is Broken, DONâ€™T USE! IMPORTANT: This smart contract is broken, DO NOT USE IT! We do not support it, and we will NOT build games for these pre-IPC IPCs. Just want to be clear on that."</I></p>

<H1>What's Demo Mode?</H1>
<p>If you go to connect wallet there is a Demo Mode that requires MetaMask. This allows the website to connect to the Ethereum network using MetaMasks api, it simulates a connection to wallet <B>0x0fd907a10932F4a09dE3ac43A557f02006A50A0D</B> (The author of this websites personal wallet). Do not attempt any transactions in this mode as they will fail and you might be charged. The purpose is to demonstrate how this website works.</p>

<H1>Is the wrapper contract verified?</H1>
<p>Yes it is, and you can view its status along with its source code <B><Link href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x61e1ea57558b81c3b62578901502fe74d5a924c1#code">HERE</Link></B>.</p>

<H1>Who can I contact if I have any questions or issues reguarding version 0 or the wrapper?</H1>
<p>I am Johnny L. de Alba, You can also email me at <B>johnnyldealba@gmail.com</B>. If you are interested in other projects I have done you can view my GitHub at <B><Link href="https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba">https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba</Link></B>.</p>
